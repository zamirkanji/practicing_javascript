There are seven basic data types in Javascript:
1. A number 
  - integers (whole numbers)
  - floating point numbers (decimals)
  - Special numeric values 
    - Infinity ( console.log(1 / 0); //Infinity )
    - -Infinity 
    - NaN (Not a number)
2. A string 
  - ""
  - ''
  - ` ${} `
3. A boolean (logical type)
  - true (yes)
  - false (no, incorrect)
4. The "null" value
  - Nothing 
  - Empty 
  - Value unknown 
5. The "undefined" value

6. Objects and Symbols
